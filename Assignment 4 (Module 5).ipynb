It involves concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.\n","\n","2)What is a class in OOP?\n","\n","Ans: A class is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP. It defines attributes (properties) and methods (functions) that an object of the class will have.\n","\n","3) What is an object in OOP?\n","\n","Ans: An object is an instance of a class. It represents an entity with specific data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n","\n","4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n","Ans: Abstraction involves hiding complex details and showing only the necessary parts. It simplifies the interface.\n","Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components (via private/protected access).\n","\n","5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans: Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\") are special methods in Python, such as __init__, __str__, and __repr__, that allow customization of basic operations like object instantiation, representation, and string conversion.\n","\n","6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n","\n","Ans: Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, enabling code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n","\n","7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n","Ans: Polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way, often through method overriding.\n","\n","8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","Ans: Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using private and protected attributes (prefixing with _ or __) and methods, limiting external access.\n","\n","9) What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n","Ans: A constructor is a special method (__init__) that is automatically called when an object is created, typically used to initialize attributes.\n","\n","10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans: Class methods: Bound to the class rather than an instance, and can modify class state. They are defined with @classmethod.\n","Static methods: Not bound to the class or an instance, and do not modify class state. Defined with @staticmethod.\n","\n","11) What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n","Ans: Python does not directly support method overloading, but it can be achieved by defining methods with default parameters or variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs).\n","\n","12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n","Ans: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n","\n","13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n","Ans: The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access to an instance's data.\n","\n","14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","Ans: Polymorphism allows code to be more flexible and reusable, enabling the same method to operate differently based on the object that calls it.\n","\n","15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n","Ans: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods, which must be implemented by subclasses.\n","\n","16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","Ans: OOP promotes code reuse, modularity, scalability, and maintainability by organizing code into objects with well-defined interfaces.\n","\n","17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n","Ans: Class variables are shared by all instances of a class.\n","Instance variables are specific to each object instance.\n","\n","18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n","Ans: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling the reuse of functionality from multiple sources.\n","\n","19) Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python?\n","\n","Ans: __str__: Returns a user-friendly string representation of an object (used by print()).\n","__repr__: Returns a developer-friendly string representation that could, in theory, be used to recreate the object.\n","\n","20) What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n","\n","Ans: The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class, typically used in the constructor or method overriding.\n","\n","21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","Ans: The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected), allowing for cleanup actions.\n","\n","22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","Ans: @staticmethod: Defines a method that doesn't access or modify class or instance state.\n","@classmethod: Defines a method that operates on the class, not instances, and can modify class-level attributes.\n","\n","23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n","Ans: Polymorphism in Python works with inheritance by allowing subclasses to override methods in the parent class, enabling different behaviors when the method is called on instances of different subclasses.\n","\n","24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","Ans: Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single line, returning the object itself or another object after each method call.\n","\n","25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","\n","Ans: The __call__ method allows an object to be used as a function, meaning you can call an instance like a function."],"metadata":{"id":"M1niLQ2AECz2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Practical Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"7hefEnzNHc9u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
